# The 'register()' function
The register() function allows us to register our component (input fields in this case) into the react-form-hook. This makes the value available for both 'form validation' and 'submission'.
By calling the register() function and supplying an input name, we receive the following methods:

1. onChange (ChangeHandler)
- onChange prop to subscribe the input change event

2. onBlur (ChangeHandler)
- onBlur prop to subscribe the input blur event

3. name (string)
- input's name being registered

We pass these methods as props to our input field by spreading the return of the register() function invokation.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
So this is what happens when you invoke and de-structure the return of the 'register()' function in your input filed:
<input {...register('email')} />

IS EQUIVALENT TO:
const { onChange, onBlur, name, ref } = register('email');
<input 
  onChange={onChange}
  onBlur={onBlur}
  name={name}
  ref={ref}
/>
