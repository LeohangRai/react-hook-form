5. The 'formState' object
This object contains information about the entire form state. It helps you keep track of the user's interaction with your form application.
Some of the values included inside the 'formState' object are as follows:
// I recommend checking out the docs to see what these values represent:
https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform/formstate

- isDirty
- dirtyFields
- touchedFields
- isSubmitted
- isSubmitSuccessful
- isSubmitting
- isLoading
- submitCount
- isValid
- isValidating
- errors

The ones that we are mostly concerned with are the 'isSubmitting' boolean flag and the 'errors' object.
